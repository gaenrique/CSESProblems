## Description
This is a repository containing all my CSES solutions. Working through the CSES website to improve my competitive programming skills.

## Building
Each section in the CSES Problem Set has its own directory. Go into a directory and use the Makefile to build a problem. Problem names are in snake case.
The executable will go into the build directory.

For example, to build the Weird Algorithm problem, go into the IntroProblems directory and type the command:

```
make weird_algorithm
```
