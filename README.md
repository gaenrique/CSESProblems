## Description
This is a repository containing all my CSES solutions. Working through the CSES website to improve my competitive programming skills.

## Building
Each section in the CSES Problem Set has its own directory. Go into a directory and use the Makefile to build a problem. Problem names are in snake case.
The executable will go into the build directory.

For example:

```
make weird_algorithm
```
